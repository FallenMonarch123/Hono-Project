This project is a full-stack quiz system built with a Next.js App Router frontend and an Express backend, designed to demonstrate a clear architecture using modern tooling. To run the project, install dependencies in both the frontend and backend folders using npm install and with the combined script to start both the backend and frontend configured you only need to do npm run dev once but have to make sure that you are running it in the project folder and not on any other folders. After launching, the app automatically routes to /quiz where users enter their name, take the quiz, and view results. The backend runs on a Node.js server using Express for route handling, while the frontend is fully client-rendered using "use client" components for stateful quiz flows. Validation is handled on both sides: the frontend ensures name and answer completeness before submission, and the backend validates incoming quiz submissions to prevent malformed data. Libraries that I used are  Lucide React, TailwindCSS, CORS , and Express for the simplicity, reliability, and fast development workflow of the project. Some trade-offs include minimal error handling, no persistent database, and simplified routing to focus on core functionality. Shortcuts were also taken in UI responsiveness and security since this is just a prototype. The time spent in the project was not that relatively long but what took the most time was the initialization of project or the start of the project because I had to relearn the installation of my react and node.js because I recleared my system storage because of a file corruption which lead to me having to start from installing the necessary libraries that I was going to use and since AI was allowed the project development was much smoother and easier to handle.
